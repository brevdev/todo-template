# Create a fully functional, scalable todo app in minutes

React App for the front end, Brev for the backend
(business in the front, party in the back?)

## Create a Brev account and clone the todo backend

Go to https://app.brev.dev/template/todo to create your Brev backend. Create your brev account here if you don't already have one: https://app.brev.dev/alphasignup

Once you have your todo app templated, copy the URL and paste it here: https://todo-template.brev.dev

## Make the app yours

The already hosted one is great for playing around with-- it's live, scalable, and hooked up. Clone this repo if you want to make it your own app.
